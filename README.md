## Gameplay

### Objective
Accumulate the highest score possible by destroying various targets within the time limit. Extend the time by destroying primary objectives.

### Mechanics
- **Movement:** Control the monster as it moves slowly but powerfully across Staten Island.
- **Attacks:**
  - **Physical Attacks:** Perform close-range attacks like punches and kicks to deal significant damage to buildings and enemies.
  - **Ranged Attacks:** Launch powerful fireballs to destroy targets from a distance, requiring a charge time during which the monster must remain stationary.

### Enemies
- **Missile Launchers:** Positioned on the mainland, they perform area attacks with missiles, providing visual cues such as rocket smoke and red impact circles.
- **Tanks:** Moving units within Staten Island that can stun the monster with their less powerful attacks. Tanks respawn when out of the camera's view and increase in number over time.

### Destruction of Buildings
- Buildings have resistance levels. Once depleted, they are destroyed with spectacular visual effects and respawn after a few seconds, growing back with a unique VFX.

## Features
- Cyberpunk-themed graphics and visual effects.
- Realistic sound effects and a steampunk-inspired soundtrack.
- Scoring system based on the destruction of various targets.
- Health bar and timer displayed on the main screen.

Open Unity Hub and click on the "Add" button to add a new project.
### Select the Project:

Navigate to the folder where you extracted or cloned the Unity project.
Select the project folder and click "Open" or "Select Folder."
Install Unity Version (if needed):

If the Unity project requires a specific Unity version that you don't have installed, Unity Hub will prompt you to download and install the required version. Follow the prompts to install it.
### Open the Project:

Once the Unity version is installed, click on the project thumbnail in Unity Hub to open the project.
Resolve Dependencies (if needed):

Unity projects may have dependencies or plugins. Check the project documentation or readme for any specific instructions on resolving dependencies. You might need to import certain assets or packages from the Unity Asset Store.
### Build the Project:

Once the project is open, go to "File" -> "Build Settings."
Choose the target platform for your build (e.g., PC, Mac, Android, iOS).
Click on "Switch Platform" if necessary.
Click on "Build" to generate the executable or project files.
### Run the Project:

After building, you can run the project by executing the generated executable or running it directly from the Unity Editor.
