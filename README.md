## Gameplay

### Objective
Accumulate the highest score possible by destroying various targets within the time limit. Extend the time by destroying primary objectives.

### Mechanics
- **Movement:** Control the monster as it moves slowly but powerfully across Staten Island.
- **Attacks:**
  - **Physical Attacks:** Perform close-range attacks like punches and kicks to deal significant damage to buildings and enemies.
  - **Ranged Attacks:** Launch powerful fireballs to destroy targets from a distance, requiring a charge time during which the monster must remain stationary.

### Enemies
- **Missile Launchers:** Positioned on the mainland, they perform area attacks with missiles, providing visual cues such as rocket smoke and red impact circles.
- **Tanks:** Moving units within Staten Island that can stun the monster with their less powerful attacks. Tanks respawn when out of the camera's view and increase in number over time.

### Destruction of Buildings
